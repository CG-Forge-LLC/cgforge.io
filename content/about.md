## Our Story
#### Bespoke Solutions For Your Production Needs

With decades of combined experience with the largest studios in the industry, we know that every studio has different challenges, from transferring video data to vendor access to production user management.

​
A prime example is the ultra high pressure, mega budget production of the Lord of the Rings: the Rings of Power. Our task was to transfer 10 to 15 terabytes of VFX dailies over a 25Gbps Direct Connect line, then disperse them to various locations around the globe. We created a tool to do just that.

​
In production cloud environments, building a studio is complex. Not every solution can be purchased off the shelf. Many productions aren’t even aware that the issues they deal with daily can be solved with custom cloud solutions.

​
At CG Forge, we create bespoke solutions to handle whatever challenge your production throws at you.  Then we give you the power to manage those solutions yourself.



## Our Achievements
- We migrated the library for the world's largest media conglomerate, using Aspera and customs AWS workflows to migrate hundreds of terabytes of content across the globe.

- We created and managed custom workflows for camera to cloud for various tent-pole productions.

- We created and managed backup solutions for one of the world's largest production studios. That included all VFX, BTS, and every camera magazine, on every production. After the season was wrapped, all assets were migrated to a centralized AWS account for long term storage.

- We created a file transfer tool specifically for the Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power production.  The LOTR production required 15 terabyte uploads each day (VFX Dailies) over a 25Gbps Direct Connect.

    - The file transfer tool featured

    - Direct from mag error checking using MHL (media hash list)

    - Fine tuning controls for maximum usage of CPU, network and memory bandwidth

    - Checksum matching to ensure assets file integrity


- We designed, built, and managed a custom Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution for over 200 productions, with hundreds of applications and over 30,000 users.

    - The CIAM allowed all user types access to the production platform:

        - FTE (Enterprise Studio Employees)

        - Studio employees

        - Production members

        - Third party vendors

- All users' identities were managed using existing identity sources. This removed the need for admins to manage account creation and access.

- The tool allowed Production Coordinators to grant access to platforms and tools in a self-service manner.

- The CIAM allowed for auditing of control changes and uniform enforcement of standards.
